# React Testing library

# What to test in a react project ?
    + Test component renders
    + Test component renders with props
    + Test component renders in different states
    + Test component reacts to events

# What not to test ?
    + Implementation details --> Test behaviour not how it is implemented
    + Third party code --> Need not to test third party code
    + Code that is not important from a user point of view --> No need to test a utility function which 
        provides date in certain format rather test whether date is rendered in appropriate format
    

# RTL Queries

    Every test we write generally involves the following basic steps
    1. Render the component
    2. Find an element rendered by the component
    3. Assert against the element found in step 2 which will pass or fail the test
    
    To render the component, we use the render method from RTL

    For assertion, we use expect passing in a value and combine it with a matcher function
        from jest or jest-dom

    Helping us find the element is RTL responsibility & core api that RTL provides is to help us
    easily find an element rendered by the component --> RTL Queries

    + Queries are the methods that RTL provides to find elements on the page
    + To find a single element on the page, we have
        getBy..
        queryBy..
        findBy..
    + To find multiple elements on the page, we have
        getAllBy..
        queryAllBy..
        findAllBy..

    The suffix can be one of Role, LabelText, PlaceHolderText, Text, DisplayValue, AltText, Title and finally TestId


# getBy.. queries

    + getBy.. class of queries return the matching node for a query, and
        throw a descriptive error if no elements match or
        if more than one match is found.
