# Mocking
    + Mocking functions with jest
        mock functions allow us to test our code without worrying about actual
            implementation of the function

    + Mocking HTTP requests
        + For mocking, when writing tests with RTL, mock service worker is the preferred package (mswjs.io)
        + msw is an API mocking library, that uses service worker library to intercept the actual requests


    + msw (mock service worker) setup
        + In docs, --> Integrate --> Node --> 
    + msw handlers
        + within this file, we are going to handle all HTTP requests, and respond with mock response
