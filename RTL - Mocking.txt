# Mocking
    + Mocking functions with jest
        mock functions allow us to test our code without worrying about actual
            implementation of the function

    + Mocking HTTP requests
        + For mocking, when writing tests with RTL, mock service worker is the preferred package (mswjs.io)
        + msw is an API mocking library, that uses service worker library to intercept the actual requests


    + msw (mock service worker) setup
        + In docs, --> Integrate --> Node --> 
    + msw handlers
        + within this file, we are going to handle all HTTP requests, and respond with mock response


# How to handle errors when mocking HTTP requests ?
    
    + How do we ask mock service worker to respond with error status instead of success status ?
        + In the test file, within the test function which tests error scenario,
          we are going to reset the handler we have defined in the main handlers file, to throw an error
            for that, we need to get hold of server from server.tsx
