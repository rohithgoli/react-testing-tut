1. Make sure you have node and git installed by checking node --version
    & git --version respectively

2. npx create-react-app . --template typescript
    to have a setup


# Running tests
    + create-react-app also provides a sample test in a test file 
        and scripts to run test in application
    + when we run that script, jest finds the tests, runs it & prints the result


# Structure or Anatomy of the test present in app.test.tsx

    + test method --> it runs a test
        + test accepts 3 arguments
            test(name, fn, timeout)
                The first argument is the test name used to identify the test
                The second argument is a function that contains the expectations to test
                    + this is where RTL comes into picture
                        Begin by creating a virtual DOM of the App Component using the render method
                        from RTL
                        screen , an object in RTL, which contains the methods to query to virtual DOM
                    + test, expect are methods from jest

                The third argument is timeout which is an optional argument for specifying how
                    long to wait before aborting the test. The default timeout value is 5 seconds.


# TDD
    + 1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
      2. Write Software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed
      3. Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass
