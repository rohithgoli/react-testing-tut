# Assertions
    + When writing tests, we often need to check that values meet certain conditions
    + Assertions decide if a test pass or fails
    + with jest, assertions are carried out with global "expect" method
        expect method needs a value as an argument
            The argument should be the value that our code produces
    + Typically, you will use expect along with a "matcher" function to assert something
        about a value
    + A matcher can optionally accept an argument which is the correct expected value 
        + What are different matcher functions to use while writing a test ?

            Refer jestDOM Custom matchers

        + setupTests is a file which is globally executed before jest runs tests
