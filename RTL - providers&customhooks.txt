# How to test component wrapped in a provider ?

    Goal: To test MuiMode component

    + RTL providers a wrapper option while rendering
        So on the render function, add a second argument, an object,
        This wraps the component with provider before rendering

    + There also exists a way to specify the wrapper option once for every test in the App

# Custom Render Functions

    + context provider wraps only a few components
    + However, for a theme provider (or) redux store provider, 
        it makes sense to add wrapper at top-level & available for every component
        resulting in not to specify the wrapper option at every test

    + A way to acheive a single wrapper across all tests, is by writing Custom Render Function
