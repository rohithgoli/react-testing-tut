# How to test component wrapped in a provider ?

    Goal: To test MuiMode component

    + RTL providers a wrapper option while rendering
        So on the render function, add a second argument, an object,
        This wraps the component with provider before rendering

    + There also exists a way to specify the wrapper option once for every test in the App
