# jest configuration

# watch mode
    + npm test --> starts jest in watch mode
    + watch mode is an option that we can pass to Jest asking to watch files
        that have changed since the last commit and execute tests related only
        to those changed files
    + An optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many
        tests you have

# Filtering tests
    + Apart from command line options, .only , .skip can be used

# Grouping tests
    + If we prefer our tests to be organised in groups, we can use 
        describe method
    + describe accepts two arguments
        describe(name, fn)
            first argument --> group name
            second argument --> a function that contains the 
                                expectations to test


    + it is possible to use .skip, .only with describe method
    + is is possible to nest describe blocks
    + there can be multiple describe blocks
